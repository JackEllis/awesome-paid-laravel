## Quality standards

We know there is _a lot_ of administration panel or starter kit on some webmaster ressources marketplace. While those appeal to a specific type of audience, if too much of those starts to get put on the list, we might decide to stop adding them alltogether. For those kind of item, please explain why it should be placed on the list !

Thanks everyone!
